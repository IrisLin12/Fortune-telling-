## Intro of Xiao Liu Ren 小六壬
Xiao Liu Ren (小六壬), also known as Little Six Ren Divination, is an ancient Chinese divination system used to predict outcomes and make decisions in everyday life. It is a simplified form of the Six Ren (六壬) system, which is part of the broader field of Chinese metaphysics and fortune-telling. Xiao Liu Ren focuses on interpreting celestial and earthly patterns through a set of specific calculations based on the traditional Chinese calendar and cosmology.

This divination method, while less complex than the full Six Ren system, is still regarded for its accuracy in providing insights on personal matters such as career, health, relationships, and important life events. Xiao Liu Ren is often used by fortune-tellers and practitioners for quick, straightforward predictions and is valued for its practicality and ease of use in daily situations.
